Mount the iso

Get core.gz

gunzip it

you'll get a CPIO archive named 'core'

make a directory to store the filesystem

go into your directory

sudo cpio -idH newc < ../core    (-i for extract, -d to create directories if
required, -H newc to specify the format to keep)
(or cpio -idH newc -F ../core, F to specify a file instead of standards in/out)

here is the full filesystem, change whatever you want (init scripts in /opt)

When you're finish, go back to the root of the filesystem and run:
sudo find . | sudo cpio -oF ../core2 -H newc    (-o to create, -H
specify how to store the files in the archive, 'newc' allow a huge number of
inodes which is perfect for filesystems, 'crc' format is the same than 'newc'
with a CRC checksum)

gzip core2, you'll get core2.gz, but rename it to core.gz after cleaning the
original core.gz

make a 'final' directory

copy the 'boot' directory in final
replace the core.gz with the new one in final/boot

change permissions owner and group of the core.gz file to be the same than other
files

Go to the parent directory of final

sudo mkisofs -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -b boot/isolinux/isolinux.bin -c boot/isolinux/boot.cat -o flihabi.iso final/

qemu-system-i386 --cdrom flihabi.iso
